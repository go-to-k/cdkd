# cdkd

**cdkd** (CDK Direct) - A from-scratch CDK CLI with its own deployment engine — provisions via AWS SDK instead of CloudFormation.

- **Direct provisioning** via AWS SDK instead of CloudFormation
- **From-scratch CDK CLI** - synthesis orchestration, asset publishing, context resolution (no aws-cdk / toolkit-lib dependency)
- **CDK compatible** - use your existing CDK app code as-is
- **Own deployment engine** - diff calculation, dependency graph, parallel execution, state management (what CloudFormation handles internally)

> **⚠️ WARNING: NOT PRODUCTION READY**
>
> This project is in early development and is **NOT suitable for production use**. Features are incomplete, APIs may change without notice, and there may be bugs that could affect your AWS infrastructure. Use at your own risk in development/testing environments only.

> **Note**: This is an experimental/educational project exploring alternative deployment approaches for AWS CDK. It is **not intended to replace** the official AWS CDK CLI, but rather to experiment with direct SDK provisioning as a learning exercise and proof of concept.

## Features

- **Synthesis orchestration**: CDK app subprocess execution, Cloud Assembly parsing, context provider loop
- **Asset handling**: Self-implemented asset publisher for S3 file assets (ZIP packaging) and Docker images (ECR)
- **Context resolution**: Self-implemented context provider loop for Vpc.fromLookup(), AZ, SSM, HostedZone, etc.
- **Hybrid provisioning**: SDK Providers for fast direct API calls, Cloud Control API fallback for broad resource coverage
- **Diff calculation**: Self-implemented resource/property-level diff between desired template and current state
- **S3-based state management**: No DynamoDB required, uses S3 conditional writes for locking
- **DAG-based parallelization**: Analyze `Ref`/`Fn::GetAtt` dependencies and execute in parallel
- **`--no-wait` for async resources**: Skip the multi-minute wait on CloudFront / RDS / ElastiCache / NAT Gateway and return as soon as the create call returns (CloudFormation always blocks)
- **VPC route DependsOn relaxation (on by default)**: Drop CDK-injected defensive `DependsOn` edges from VPC Lambdas onto private-subnet routes so `CloudFront::Distribution` and `Lambda::Url` start their ~3-min propagation in parallel with NAT Gateway stabilization (~50% faster on VPC + Lambda + CloudFront stacks). Pass `--no-aggressive-vpc-parallel` to opt out.

> **Note**: Resource types not covered by either SDK Providers or Cloud Control API cannot be deployed with cdkd. If you encounter an unsupported resource type, deployment will fail with a clear error message.

## Benchmark

**cdkd deploys up to ~5x faster than AWS CDK (CloudFormation).**

Measured on `us-east-1` with 5 independent resources per stack (fully parallelized by cdkd's DAG scheduler).

### SDK Provider path — **4.8x faster** (20.5s vs 98.4s)

Stack: S3 Bucket, DynamoDB Table, SQS Queue, SNS Topic, SSM Parameter.

| Phase | cdkd | AWS CDK (CFn) | Speedup |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Synthesis | 3.5s | 4.1s | 1.2x |
| Deploy | 17.0s | 94.4s | **5.5x** |
| **Total** | **20.5s** | **98.4s** | **4.8x** |

### Cloud Control API fallback path — **1.5x faster** (44.6s vs 69.1s)

Stack: SSM Document × 3 + Athena WorkGroup × 2 (no SDK provider — CC API fallback).

| Phase | cdkd | AWS CDK (CFn) | Speedup |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Synthesis | 3.7s | 4.2s | 1.1x |
| Deploy | 40.9s | 64.9s | **1.6x** |
| **Total** | **44.6s** | **69.1s** | **1.5x** |

### Resource Provisioning

cdkd ships **90+ dedicated SDK Providers** (direct AWS SDK calls, no
polling overhead) covering the most-used services — IAM, Lambda, S3,
DynamoDB, EC2, RDS, ECS, API Gateway, CloudFront, Step Functions, EFS,
KMS, Cognito, AppSync, and more. **Any other CloudFormation resource
type** is handled via the Cloud Control API fallback (async polling).
Resource types not supported by either path fail at deploy time with a
clear error.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 20.0.0
- **AWS CDK Bootstrap**: You must run `cdk bootstrap` before using cdkd. cdkd uses CDK's bootstrap bucket (`cdk-hnb659fds-assets-*`) for asset uploads (Lambda code, Docker images). Custom bootstrap qualifiers are supported — CDK embeds the correct bucket/repo names in the asset manifest during synthesis.
- **AWS Credentials**: Configured via environment variables, `~/.aws/credentials`, or `--profile` option

## Installation

### From npm

```bash
npm i -g @go-to-k/cdkd          # latest release
npm i -g @go-to-k/cdkd@0.0.2    # pin to a specific version
```

The installed binary is `cdkd` — run it the same way in either install path.

> cdkd is an experimental / educational project and is not intended for production use — see the warning at the top of this README. Pin to a specific version if you need reproducible installs.

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd.git
cd cdkd
pnpm install
pnpm run build
npm link
```

If `cdkd` is not found after `npm link`, set an alias in the current shell:

```bash
alias cdkd="node $(pwd)/dist/cli.js"
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Bootstrap (creates S3 state bucket - only needed once per account/region)
cdkd bootstrap

# List stacks in the CDK app
cdkd list

# Deploy your CDK app
cdkd deploy

# Check what would change
cdkd diff

# Tear down
cdkd destroy
```

That's it. cdkd reads `--app` from `cdk.json` and auto-resolves the state bucket from your AWS account ID (`cdkd-state-{accountId}`). If you bootstrapped under a previous cdkd version, the legacy region-suffixed name (`cdkd-state-{accountId}-{region}`) is still picked up automatically with a deprecation warning.

## Usage

Options like `--app`, `--state-bucket`, and `--context` can be omitted if configured via `cdk.json` or environment variables (`CDKD_APP`, `CDKD_STATE_BUCKET`).

```bash
# Bootstrap (create S3 bucket for state)
cdkd bootstrap \
  --state-bucket my-cdkd-state \
  --region us-east-1

# Synthesize only
cdkd synth --app "npx ts-node app.ts"

# List all stacks in the CDK app (alias: ls)
cdkd list
cdkd ls
cdkd list --long              # YAML records with id/name/environment
cdkd list --long --json       # same, but JSON
cdkd list --show-dependencies # id + dependency list per stack
cdkd list 'MyStage/*'         # filter by display path (CDK CLI parity)

# Deploy from a pre-synthesized cloud assembly directory
cdkd deploy --app cdk.out

# Deploy (single stack auto-detected, reads --app from cdk.json)
cdkd deploy

# Deploy specific stack(s)
cdkd deploy MyStack
cdkd deploy Stack1 Stack2

# Deploy all stacks
cdkd deploy --all

# Deploy with wildcard (matched against the physical CloudFormation stack name)
cdkd deploy 'My*'

# Deploy stacks under a CDK Stage using the hierarchical path (CDK CLI parity)
# Patterns containing '/' are routed to the CDK display path; both forms work:
cdkd deploy 'MyStage/*'        # all stacks under MyStage
cdkd deploy MyStage/Api        # specific stack by display path
cdkd deploy MyStage-Api        # same stack by physical CloudFormation name

# Deploy with context values
cdkd deploy -c env=staging -c featureFlag=true

# Deploy with explicit options
cdkd deploy MyStack \
  --app "npx ts-node app.ts" \
  --state-bucket my-cdkd-state \
  --verbose

# Show diff (what would change)
cdkd diff MyStack

# Dry run (plan only, no changes)
cdkd deploy --dry-run

# Deploy with no rollback on failure (Terraform-style)
cdkd deploy --no-rollback

# Deploy only the specified stack (skip dependency auto-inclusion)
cdkd deploy -e MyStack

# Destroy resources
cdkd destroy MyStack
cdkd destroy --all --force

# Force-unlock a stale lock from interrupted deploy
cdkd force-unlock MyStack

# Adopt already-deployed AWS resources into cdkd state.
# See docs/import.md for the full guide (auto / selective / hybrid modes,
# --resource overrides, --resource-mapping CDK CLI compatibility).
cdkd import MyStack --dry-run
cdkd import MyStack --yes

# Inspect state-bucket info on demand (bucket name, region, source, schema version, stack count).
# Routine commands (deploy / destroy / etc.) no longer print the bucket banner by default —
# pass --verbose to surface it in their debug logs, or use this subcommand for an explicit answer.
cdkd state info
cdkd state info --json        # JSON output for tooling
cdkd state info --state-bucket my-bucket  # explicit bucket; reports Source: --state-bucket flag

# List stacks registered in the cdkd state bucket
cdkd state list
cdkd state ls --long          # include resource count, last-modified, lock status
cdkd state list --json        # JSON output (alone, or combined with --long)

# List resources of a single stack from state
cdkd state resources MyStack          # aligned columns: LogicalID, Type, PhysicalID
cdkd state resources MyStack --long   # per-resource block with dependencies and attributes
cdkd state resources MyStack --json   # full JSON array

# Show full state record for a stack (metadata, outputs, all resources incl. properties)
cdkd state show MyStack
cdkd state show MyStack --json        # raw {state, lock} JSON

# Orphan one or more RESOURCES from cdkd's state (does NOT delete AWS resources).
# Per-resource, mirrors aws-cdk-cli's `cdk orphan --unstable=orphan`.
# Synth-driven — needs --app / cdk.json. Construct paths use CDK's L2-style form
# (`<StackName>/<Path/To/Construct>`); the synthesized `/Resource` suffix is
# matched implicitly. Passing an L2 wrapper that contains multiple CFn resources
# orphans every child under it (matches upstream's prefix-match semantics).
cdkd orphan MyStack/MyTable                    # confirmation prompt (y/N)
cdkd orphan MyStack/MyTable --yes
cdkd orphan MyStack/MyTable MyStack/MyBucket   # multiple resources, same stack
cdkd orphan MyStack/MyTable --dry-run          # print rewrite audit, no save
cdkd orphan MyStack/MyTable --force            # also fall back to cached
                                               # attributes when live fetch fails

# State-driven counterpart that orphans a WHOLE STACK's state record
# (no CDK app needed — works against the bucket).
cdkd state orphan MyStack             # confirmation prompt (y/N)
cdkd state orphan MyStack --yes       # skip confirmation
cdkd state orphan StackA StackB --force # also bypass the locked-stack refusal

# Destroy a stack's AWS resources AND remove its state record, without
# requiring the CDK app (no synth — works from any working directory).
cdkd state destroy MyStack            # per-stack confirmation prompt
cdkd state destroy MyStack OtherStack --yes
cdkd state destroy --all -y           # every stack in the bucket
cdkd state destroy MyStack --region us-east-1
```

> **`destroy` vs `orphan`** (matches aws-cdk-cli's new `cdk orphan`):
> `destroy` deletes the AWS resources AND the state record. `orphan` deletes
> ONLY the state record — AWS resources remain intact, just no longer
> tracked by cdkd.
>
> The two `orphan` variants now operate at different granularities:
>
> - `cdkd orphan <constructPath>...` — synth-driven, **per-resource**.
>   Removes specific resources from a stack's state file and rewrites every
>   sibling reference (Ref / Fn::GetAtt / Fn::Sub / dependencies) so the
>   next deploy doesn't re-create the orphan or fail on a stale reference.
>   Mirrors `cdk orphan --unstable=orphan`.
> - `cdkd state orphan <stack>...` — state-driven, **whole-stack**. Removes
>   the entire state record for a stack from the bucket. Works without the
>   CDK app.
>
> `cdkd destroy` (synth-driven, deletes AWS resources + state) and
> `cdkd state destroy` (state-driven, same effect) round out the matrix.

## `--no-wait`: skip async-resource waits

CloudFront Distributions, RDS Clusters/Instances, ElastiCache, and
NAT Gateways typically take 1–15 minutes for AWS to fully provision.
By default cdkd waits for them to reach a ready state — the same
behavior as CloudFormation. Pass `--no-wait` to return as soon as the
create call returns:

```bash
cdkd deploy --no-wait
```

The resource is fully functional once AWS finishes the async
deployment in the background. CloudFormation has no equivalent — once
you submit a stack, you wait for everything.

NAT Gateway is included as of v0.31. Provisioning typically takes
1–2 minutes and is the dominant cost in many VPC stacks; with
`cdkd deploy --no-wait`, `CreateNatGateway` returns the `NatGatewayId`
immediately and dependent Routes that only reference the ID can
proceed against a still-`pending` gateway. AWS continues NAT
provisioning asynchronously after the deploy returns. Use this only
when nothing in the deploy flow needs actual NAT-routed egress (e.g.
no Lambda invoked during deploy that hits the internet).

`--no-wait` is **deploy-only**. `cdkd destroy` always waits for NAT
Gateway to reach `deleted` state — while the gateway is in
`deleting` AWS keeps the ENI / EIP / route-table associations
attached, so any concurrent `DeleteSubnet` / `DeleteInternetGateway`
/ `DeleteVpc` returns `DependencyViolation` and the destroy enters a
retry storm. Other `--no-wait` resources (CloudFront / RDS /
ElastiCache) don't apply to destroy either — their providers are
already non-blocking on delete because they're leaves in the destroy
DAG.

## VPC route DependsOn relaxation (on by default)

CDK synth eagerly injects `DependsOn` from VPC Lambdas (and adjacent
IAM Role / Policy / Lambda::Url / EventSourceMapping resources) onto
the private subnet's `DefaultRoute` / `RouteTableAssociation` so that
nothing tries to invoke the Lambda before its egress path to the
internet is up. The dependency is real at *runtime* (a Lambda code
call to a third-party API can't reach the internet without a NAT
route), but it is NOT required at *deploy time* — `CreateFunction` /
`CreateFunctionUrlConfig` / `AddPermission` /
`CreateEventSourceMapping` all accept a function in `Pending` state.

For VPC + Lambda + CloudFront stacks the strict-CDK-ordering chain is serial:

```text
NAT GW (~2-3 min) → DefaultRoute → Lambda → Lambda::Url → Distribution propagation (~3 min)
```

cdkd drops the route DependsOn by default so Distribution + Lambda::Url
dispatch right after IAM Role / Subnet are ready and propagate in
parallel with NAT stabilization:

| Mode | Critical path | Total |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--no-aggressive-vpc-parallel` (opt-out) | NAT → Lambda → CF (serial) | ~6 min |
| **default** | max(NAT, CF) | **~3 min** |

Measured **−54.6%** on `tests/integration/bench-cdk-sample` (398.59s
with `--no-aggressive-vpc-parallel` → 181.03s default).

To opt out (e.g. for a stack with a Custom Resource that synchronously
invokes a VPC Lambda outside cdkd's Lambda-ServiceToken Active wait):

```bash
cdkd deploy --no-aggressive-vpc-parallel
```

Deploy-only — the relaxation has no effect on destroy ordering (the
route DependsOn doesn't constrain delete-time correctness; Lambda
hyperplane ENI release is the actual destroy bottleneck and is handled
separately by `lambda-vpc-deps.ts`).

See [docs/cli-reference.md](docs/cli-reference.md) for the full
type-pair allowlist, implementation pointers, and trade-off notes.

## Other CLI flags

For concurrency knobs (`--concurrency`, `--stack-concurrency`,
`--asset-publish-concurrency`, `--image-build-concurrency`) and
per-resource timeout flags (`--resource-warn-after`,
`--resource-timeout` — including the per-resource-type override syntax
and the rationale for the 30m default), see
**[docs/cli-reference.md](docs/cli-reference.md)**.

## Exit codes

cdkd commands distinguish three outcomes via the process exit code so
CI / bench scripts can react without grepping log output:

| Exit | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | Success — command completed and no resources are in an error state |
| `1` | Command-level failure — auth error, bad arguments, synth crash, unhandled exception |
| `2` | **Partial failure** — work completed but one or more resources failed (state.json is preserved, re-running typically resolves it) |

Exit `2` is currently emitted by `cdkd destroy` and `cdkd state
destroy` when one or more per-resource deletes fail. The summary line
also switches from `✓ Stack X destroyed` to `⚠ Stack X partially
destroyed (...). State preserved — re-run 'cdkd destroy' / 'cdkd
state destroy' to clean up.` so the visual marker matches the exit
code.

## Example

```typescript
const table = new dynamodb.Table(stack, 'Table', {
  partitionKey: { name: 'id', type: dynamodb.AttributeType.STRING },
});
const fn = new lambda.Function(stack, 'Handler', {
  runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_20_X,
  handler: 'index.handler',
  code: lambda.Code.fromAsset('lambda'),
  environment: { TABLE_NAME: table.tableName },
});
table.grantReadWriteData(fn);
```

```bash
$ cdkd deploy
LambdaStack
  ServiceRole     CREATE  AWS::IAM::Role             ✓  (2.1s)
  Table           CREATE  AWS::DynamoDB::Table        ✓  (1.8s)
  DefaultPolicy   CREATE  AWS::IAM::Policy            ✓  (1.5s)
  Handler         CREATE  AWS::Lambda::Function       ✓  (3.4s)

✓ Deployed LambdaStack (4 resources, 7.2s)
```

Resources are dispatched as soon as their own dependencies complete (event-driven DAG). ServiceRole and Table run in parallel; DefaultPolicy starts the moment ServiceRole is done — without waiting for Table — and Handler starts the moment DefaultPolicy is done.

## Importing existing resources

`cdkd import` adopts AWS resources that are already deployed (via
`cdk deploy`, manual creation, or another tool) into cdkd state so the
next `cdkd deploy` updates them in-place instead of CREATEing duplicates.

```bash
# Adopt a whole stack previously deployed by cdk deploy (tag-based auto-lookup).
cdkd import MyStack --yes

# Adopt only specific resources (CDK CLI parity).
cdkd import MyStack --resource MyBucket=my-bucket-name

# Migrate off CloudFormation in one shot — adopt + retire the source CFn stack.
cdkd import MyStack --migrate-from-cloudformation --yes
```

See **[docs/import.md](docs/import.md)** for the full guide: three import
modes (auto / selective / hybrid), `--resource-mapping` CDK CLI
compatibility, CloudFormation migration flow, provider coverage, and the
parity matrix vs upstream `cdk import`.

## State Management

State is stored in S3 with optimistic locking via S3 Conditional Writes
(no DynamoDB required). Keys are scoped by `(stackName, region)` so the
same stack deployed to two regions has two independent state files.

| Setting | CLI | cdk.json | Env var | Default |
|---------|-----|----------|---------|---------|
| Bucket | `--state-bucket` | `context.cdkd.stateBucket` | `CDKD_STATE_BUCKET` | `cdkd-state-{accountId}` (legacy `cdkd-state-{accountId}-{region}` is still read with a deprecation warning — run `cdkd state migrate` to consolidate) |
| Prefix | `--state-prefix` | - | - | `cdkd` |

The state bucket is shared across all CDK apps in the same account by
default. To isolate apps, pass different `--state-prefix` values.
`cdkd destroy --all` only targets stacks from the current CDK app
(determined by synthesis), not all stacks in the bucket.

See **[docs/state-management.md](docs/state-management.md)** for the full
spec: S3 key layout, optimistic-locking mechanism (ETag-based), state
schema, legacy `version: 1` migration, bucket-name migration via
`cdkd state migrate`, and troubleshooting.

## Stack Outputs

CDK's `CfnOutput` constructs are resolved and stored in the state file:

```typescript
// In your CDK code
new cdk.CfnOutput(this, 'BucketArn', {
  value: bucket.bucketArn,  // Uses Fn::GetAtt internally
  description: 'ARN of the bucket',
});
```

After deployment, outputs are resolved and saved to the S3 state file:

```json
{
  "outputs": {
    "BucketArn": "arn:aws:s3:::actual-bucket-name-xyz"
  }
}
```

**Key differences from CloudFormation**:

- CloudFormation: Outputs accessible via `aws cloudformation describe-stacks`
- cdkd: Outputs saved in S3 state file (e.g., `s3://bucket/cdkd/MyStack/us-east-1/state.json`)
- Both resolve intrinsic functions (Ref, Fn::GetAtt, etc.) to actual values
