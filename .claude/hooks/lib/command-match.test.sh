# Smoke test for lib/command-match.sh (issue #1455).
#
# The gate hooks each have their own smoke test; this one pins the SHARED
# matcher directly, so a regression is reported once and precisely instead of
# as a scatter of failures across thirteen hook tests.
#
# Run from the repo root: `bash .claude/hooks/lib/command-match.test.sh`.
