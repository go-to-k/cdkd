# PreToolUse hook. Blocks `git commit` and `git push` when the working
# tree the command will actually act on is on `main` / `master`. All
# changes to cdkd must land via PR from a feature branch — direct
# commits/pushes to main are not allowed.
#
# WHY the cwd-aware resolution matters: this repo is regularly worked
# in via `git worktree`. The previous implementation derived the repo
# root from `BASH_SOURCE` (the hook script's location), which in a
# worktree-copy invocation pointed at the worktree itself — so the
# hook checked the worktree's branch (a feature branch) and allowed
# the commit, even when the user's actual command did
# `cd /path/to/parent && git commit` and the commit landed on the
# parent worktree's `main`. Real-world incident: 2026-05-04 lambda fix
# session, see memory feedback_git_use_C_in_worktree.md.
#
# Resolution order for "where will the git command actually run":
#   1. Explicit `git -C <path> commit/push` — last `-C` wins.
#   2. Leading `cd <path> && ...` — the cd target.
#   3. The hook input's `cwd` field (the Bash tool's persisted cwd).
#   4. The hook process's own $PWD (fallback, almost never reached).

# Shared command-position matcher (issue #1455): catches the guarded verb
# after ANY chained command (`git push && gh pr create`), not just after an
# optional leading `cd`. See .claude/hooks/lib/command-match.sh.
# shellcheck source=lib/command-match.sh
__hook_dir="${BASH_SOURCE[0]%/*}"
# `%/*` leaves the string unchanged when the path has no slash (invoked as
# `bash verify-pr-gate.sh` from inside the hooks dir), which would look for
# `<script-name>/lib/...`. Fall back to the cwd in that case.

# quoted spans are stripped, then the verb is matched at line start OR
# after a `&&` / `||` / `;` / `|` operator. That catches chained
# invocations the old line-start anchor missed, while a quoted mention
# still does not fire (it is removed rather than dodged by position).
