# PreToolUse hook. Blocks `git commit` unless both the `check` and
# `docs` markgate markers are fresh for the current content state.
# Each gate is scoped (see .markgate.yml) so edits to tests-only
# invalidate only `check`, and edits to docs-only invalidate only
# `docs`. Error messages identify which gate needs re-running.
#
# WHY the cwd-aware resolution matters (cdkd #559): this repo is
# regularly worked in via `git worktree`, and markgate stores marker
# state per-worktree at `<git rev-parse --absolute-git-dir>/markgate/`.
# The pre-#559 implementation derived REPO from `BASH_SOURCE` and
# always landed on the main working tree, defeating markgate's
# per-worktree isolation and forcing every parallel agent to converge
# on the main tree's view (see memory rule
# feedback_cross_agent_main_tree_contention.md). We now resolve the
# target working tree from the PreToolUse payload's `cwd` field +
# leading `cd <path>` + last `git -C <path>` flag, exactly mirroring
# branch-gate.sh / integ-local-gate.sh, so the markgate verify runs
# against the worktree the commit will actually land in.

# between `git` and the `commit` subcommand. Anchored so `commit`
