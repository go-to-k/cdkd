# the path below is `${BASH_SOURCE[0]}`-relative, so a copy run from a scratch
# directory resolves a hook that is not there and every case fails with 127.
#
# Both polarities are exercised. A Stop hook that only ever proves it FIRES
# cannot notice itself starting to fire on every turn, and a warning that cries
# wolf on a clean tree is one people learn to scroll past -- which is the same
# outcome as not having it.

# `pwd -P` is load-bearing, not tidiness. On macOS `mktemp -d` hands back a
# path under `/var/folders/...` whose real location is `/private/var/...`, and
# the hook derives its own root with `cd ... && pwd`, which canonicalises. Git,
# meanwhile, records a worktree under whatever path it was CREATED with. So an
# uncanonicalised sandbox makes the hook's root and git's listing two spellings
# of one directory that never compare equal -- and any case whose subject is an
# equality between those two paths passes no matter what the hook does. That is
# how the self-lane case below was measured VACUOUS on its first attempt: the
# defect it was written for (a skip keyed on the hook's own checkout) could be
# reintroduced and the suite stayed green.
