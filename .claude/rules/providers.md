# Provider Pattern

```typescript
interface ResourceProvider {
  create(logicalId: string, resourceType: string, properties: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<ResourceCreateResult>;
  update(logicalId: string, physicalId: string, resourceType: string, properties: Record<string, unknown>, previousProperties: Record<string, unknown>): Promise<ResourceUpdateResult>;
  delete(logicalId: string, physicalId: string, resourceType: string, properties?: Record<string, unknown>, context?: DeleteContext): Promise<void>;
  getAttribute(physicalId: string, resourceType: string, attributeName: string): Promise<unknown>;
}
```

The `context.expectedRegion` parameter on `delete` is the region recorded
in the stack state when the resource was created. Providers MUST verify
the AWS client's region against `context.expectedRegion` (via the shared
`assertRegionMatch()` helper in `src/provisioning/region-check.ts`)
before treating a `*NotFound` error as idempotent delete success — see
"DELETE idempotency" below and [docs/provider-development.md](../../docs/provider-development.md).

`context.forceDataDelete` (issue #1340) is explicit user consent to destroy
the DATA a resource still contains — set ONLY by the deploy engine's
replacement / recreate delete sites when `--force-stateful-recreation` was
passed, never by plain `cdkd destroy`. Providers whose delete API fails by
default on contained data (S3 bucket / S3 Express directory bucket
auto-empty, ECR `force: true`) MUST
gate that force-cleanup on this flag OR a template-borne opt-in (CDK's
`aws-cdk:auto-delete-objects` / `aws-cdk:auto-delete-images` tags,
`EmptyOnDelete: true` — shared helpers in
`src/provisioning/data-delete-intent.ts`), and otherwise surface AWS's
not-empty error like CloudFormation's DELETE_FAILED. Do NOT add
unconditional force-cleanup to a new provider's delete — verify CFn's
actual delete behavior by live A/B first (CFn hard-deletes more than
folklore says: SecretsManager no-recovery-window and IAM role
force-detach are PARITY, verified 2026-08-02).

`context.finalSnapshotIdentifier` (issue #1352) means the resource's
`DeletionPolicy` is `Snapshot`: the provider MUST create a final snapshot
under that identifier as part of the delete — the atomic-parameter types
(RDS DBInstance / DBCluster, Neptune / DocDB clusters, ElastiCache
CacheCluster) flip their delete call from `SkipFinalSnapshot: true` to the
API's final-snapshot form. The delete call sites only pass the field for
types in `ATOMIC_FINAL_SNAPSHOT_TYPES`
(`src/provisioning/final-snapshot.ts`) on the SDK route; the
`PRE_DELETE_SNAPSHOT_TYPES` (EC2 Volume, Redshift Cluster, ElastiCache
ReplicationGroup — issue #1353) are snapshotted engine-side pre-delete via
`createPreDeleteFinalSnapshot`, and any other Snapshot-tagged shape
(cc-api routing included) is refused before any delete. The call sites are
`cdkd destroy` / `cdkd state destroy` (`destroy-runner.ts`), the deploy
engine's DELETE + replacement / recreate deletes
(`prepareFinalSnapshotForDelete`), and — since issue #1358 — the rollback of
a CREATE (`rollback-executor.ts`'s `delete-with-final-snapshot` action,
driving both the automatic post-failure rollback and `cdkd rollback`), plus
the FAILED in-flight CREATE's delete under `cdkd rollback --revert-failed`
(`delete-failed-create-with-final-snapshot`, issue #1362 — same matrix, same
refusals). When
adding final-snapshot support for a new type, extend the sets there — never
make a provider silently ignore the field.

Register Provider for each resource type in Provider Registry:

```typescript
const registry = ProviderRegistry.getInstance();
registry.register('AWS::IAM::Role', new IAMRoleProvider());
```

## Custom Resources

- Supports Lambda-backed Custom Resources
- Create/Update/Delete lifecycle
- ResponseURL uses S3 pre-signed URL for cfn-response handlers
- **Response-bucket region correction (issue #1195).** The response bucket is cdkd's STATE bucket, which can live in a different region from the deploy region (account-scoped region-free default bucket). Before the first response-bucket S3 operation (placeholder `PutObject` + `ResponseURL` presign in `generateResponseURL`), `ensureResponseClient()` lazily resolves the bucket's actual region via the shared `rebuildClientForBucketRegion` helper (#827) and swaps in a region-corrected client — a pre-signed URL's host is region-specific, so signing with the deploy region against a foreign-region bucket 301s (`PermanentRedirect`). `setResponseBucket(bucket)` deliberately takes NO region parameter (issue #1202): correction always starts from the shared `AwsClients.s3` client, so `--profile` / static credentials carry into both the `GetBucketLocation` probe and the rebuilt client, and every call site (deploy / destroy / drift / state / rollback) is corrected the same lazy way.
- CDK Provider framework: isCompleteHandler/onEventHandler async pattern detection
- Async CRUD with polling (max 1hr), pre-signed URL validity 2hr
- Sets `disableOuterRetry = true` on the `ResourceProvider` interface so the deploy engine's outer `withRetry` loop does NOT re-invoke `provider.create()` on transient SDK errors. Each invocation derives a fresh pre-signed S3 URL and RequestId via `prepareInvocation()`; an outer retry would strand the first attempt's Lambda response at an S3 key nobody polls. Internal exponential-backoff polling on the response key handles eventual consistency on its own.
- **Transient IAM-authorization retry (CR-internal).** Because cdkd's fast SDK path attaches a backing Lambda's execution-role inline policy and invokes the function ~1s later, the function can cold-start before IAM propagates the policy to its assumed-role session — caching stale, policy-less credentials for the warm container's life. The CDK Provider framework's first invoke / `waitUntilFunctionActive` (`lambda:GetFunction`) then 403s ("not authorized to perform" / "not in the state functionActive") and the custom resource FAILs. CloudFormation never hits this because its deployment latency lets IAM settle; cdkd does NOT, so `invokeCustomResourceWithRetry()` re-invokes (default 2 retries; `CDKD_CR_AUTHZ_MAX_RETRIES`, 0 disables) when the FAILED reason matches the NARROW IAM-authz signal set (`CR_TRANSIENT_AUTHZ_SIGNALS` — `not authorized to perform` / `no identity-based policy allows` / `not in the state functionActive` / `cannot be assumed` / `is unable to assume`; generic timeouts / handler bugs are deliberately NOT retried). Each retry derives a fresh pre-signed URL/RequestId AND recycles the backing function's execution environment via a no-op `UpdateFunctionConfiguration` (so the next cold start re-assumes the role with the now-propagated policy — a plain re-invoke would reuse the same warm container's stale creds). This is the CR-path analogue of the IAM-propagation retry `withRetry` already applies to every other resource (the CR path opts out of `withRetry` via `disableOuterRetry`, so it retries internally instead). Verified end-to-end via the `custom-resource-provider` integ.
- Implements `getMinResourceTimeoutMs()` returning `asyncResponseTimeoutMs` (default 1h) so the deploy engine's per-resource deadline auto-lifts to the polling cap for CR resources only — Custom-Resource-heavy stacks no longer need `--resource-timeout 1h`. A user-supplied `--resource-timeout AWS::CloudFormation::CustomResource=<DURATION>` per-type override still wins as the explicit escape hatch.
- **Delete fail-fast when the backing Lambda is gone (issue #804).** `delete()` issues a single `GetFunction` pre-check before preparing the invocation; a definitive `ResourceNotFoundException` logs a warning and treats the Custom Resource as already deleted (warn-and-continue is the delete path's existing policy). Without it, a re-run after an interrupted / partially-failed destroy entered `waitForBackingLambdaReady`, whose SDK waiters classify `ResourceNotFoundException` as RETRY and poll `GetFunction` for the full 10-minute `maxWaitTime`. Inconclusive pre-check errors (throttle, IAM) fall through to the normal invoke path; SNS-backed tokens skip the pre-check; create / update never pre-check (they must fail loudly against a missing function).
- Implemented in `CustomResourceProvider`

## Reading a field off an AWS response: type != populated

An AWS SDK v3 response TYPE declaring a field does NOT mean the API you called
populates it. The models are shared across operations, so a `List*` summary can
declare `Tags?: Tag[]` and never carry tags. AWS documents the exception on the
COMMAND, not the model:

> IAM resource-listing operations return a subset of the available attributes
> for the resource. For example, this operation does not return tags, even
> though they are an attribute of the returned object. To view all of the
> information for an instance profile, see GetInstanceProfile.

`iam-instance-profile-provider` carried exactly this defect until PR #1127:
`import()` read tags off the `ListInstanceProfiles` summary, which typechecked
and always saw `undefined`. Because a tag-walk non-match is not an error, the
walk simply never matched and `cdkd import` reported the resource as
**not-found** — a silent wrong answer, not a crash. The provider's unit tests
hand-fed inline `Tags` and so agreed with the bug.

**When consuming a field from a `List*` / `Describe*` response:**

- Read the command doc
  (`node_modules/@aws-sdk/client-*/dist-types/commands/<Op>Command.d.ts`), not
  just the model in `models/models_*.d.ts`. Types prove SHAPE; only the command
  doc (or a live call against a populated account) proves POPULATION.
- Prefer a per-candidate `Get*` when the list form is documented as a subset.
  The extra call is the correct cost.
- A live probe that comes back empty because the account has no such resource is
  **inconclusive**, not confirmation.
- Ask of any test: "would this still pass if the API returned nothing for this
  field?" If yes, it pins your assumption, not the behavior.

## Adding a New SDK Provider

1. Create new file in `src/provisioning/providers/`
2. Implement `ResourceProvider` interface
3. Register in `src/provisioning/register-providers.ts` within the `registerAllProviders()` function
4. Refresh the CFn schema fixture for the new type: `node scripts/refresh-cfn-schemas.mjs --only-missing` (requires AWS credentials with `cloudformation:DescribeType`). Then classify every unaccounted property into `handledProperties` (if `create()`/`update()` wires the field) or `unhandledByDesign` (with a one-line rationale) so the new `property-coverage` test stays green — see [docs/provider-development.md](../../docs/provider-development.md) §3c. If the provider FORWARDS a nested config blob (a `handledProperties` entry whose value is a nested object/array the provider re-shapes for the SDK), ALSO add it to `NESTED_KEY_TARGETS` in `scripts/gen-nested-key-coverage.ts` — the critic's first run audits every nested key spelling against the SDK model (the #1370 silent-drop class, issue #1373).
5. Write tests
6. Add the resource type to [docs/supported-resources.md](../../docs/supported-resources.md) (deploy/manage capability table) AND to [docs/import.md](../../docs/import.md) (import-side coverage: auto-lookup vs override-only vs sub-resource)
7. **If the provider gates a stabilization wait on `process.env['CDKD_NO_WAIT']`** (i.e. `--no-wait` skips a multi-minute poll for this type), add the resource type to the `--no-wait` docs in ALL of: the `--no-wait` table + intro in [docs/cli-reference.md](../../docs/cli-reference.md), the `--no-wait` feature bullet in [README.md](../../README.md), and the `noWaitOption` help string + JSDoc in [src/cli/options.ts](../../src/cli/options.ts). Enforced by `tests/unit/provisioning/no-wait-doc-coverage.test.ts` (fails CI if a `CDKD_NO_WAIT`-honoring provider has no handled type in the cli-reference table). The `AWS::Lambda::MicrovmImage` provider shipped honoring `--no-wait` but missed this list — the test is the backstop.

   The same 4-site rule applies to the opposite end of the axis,
   `process.env['CDKD_FULL_WAIT']` (`--full-wait`, issue
   [#1275](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1275)): a provider that
   waits ONLY under `--full-wait` belongs in the same wait-semantics table AND
   in the `--full-wait` section of
   [docs/cli-reference.md](../../docs/cli-reference.md). Enforced by
   `tests/unit/provisioning/full-wait-doc-coverage.test.ts` (added when
   `AWS::CloudFront::Distribution` joined `AWS::ECS::Service` as the second
   such type, issue [#1282](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1282)).

   Before adding EITHER kind of wait, settle the completion definition per
   [docs/cli-reference.md](../../docs/cli-reference.md)'s wait-semantics rule:
   where CloudFormation and Terraform agree, match them; where they disagree,
   the default takes the dev/test-friendly side and `--full-wait` opts into the
   CloudFormation one. A default may take the fast side even where BOTH
   engines wait, but only under the 3-condition fast-side clause (issue
   #1282, recorded in the cli-reference wait-semantics intro): (a) no
   in-deploy consumer of the waited-for state, (b) no failure signal in the
   wait, and (c) the comparison tool has both modes so the benchmark can
   report two like-for-like rows. Record the divergence in the table rather
   than leaving it implicit in provider code.

See [docs/provider-development.md](../../docs/provider-development.md) for details.
