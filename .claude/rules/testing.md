# Testing Strategy

## Unit Tests

- `tests/unit/**/*.test.ts`
- Uses Vitest
- Mocking: Mock AWS SDK with vi.mock()

## Integration Tests

- `tests/integration/**`
- Uses actual AWS account
- Environment variables: `STATE_BUCKET`, `AWS_REGION`
- Examples verified with real AWS deployments (see `tests/integration/` for full list)

## UPDATE Testing

- Environment variable `CDKD_TEST_UPDATE=true` enables UPDATE test mode
- Example: `tests/integration/basic/lib/basic-stack.ts`
- Allows testing UPDATE operations without modifying code
- JSON Patch (RFC 6902) verified working for S3, Lambda, IAM resources

## Rollback Testing (failure injection)

- Environment variable `CDKD_TEST_FAIL=true` injects a deliberately-failing
  resource (an `AWS::SQS::Queue` with an out-of-range `MessageRetentionPeriod`)
  into the `basic` stack
- Verifies against real AWS that already-completed siblings get rolled back
  when one resource fails: `CDKD_TEST_FAIL=true cdkd deploy CdkdBasicExample`
- After rollback, S3 and SSM Document should both be deleted and state file
  should be empty
