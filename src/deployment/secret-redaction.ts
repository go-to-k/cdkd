/**
 * Secret redaction for resolved dynamic references (GHSA fix).
 *
 * CloudFormation dynamic references (`{{resolve:secretsmanager:...}}`) are
 * resolved to plaintext by `IntrinsicFunctionResolver.resolveDynamicReferences`
 * so the concrete secret can be handed to the AWS API on create / update. That
 * plaintext must NEVER be persisted to cdkd state or shown in CLI output, or
 * anyone with read access to the state bucket / terminal logs recovers the
 * secret — which defeats the entire point of storing it in Secrets Manager.
 *
 * The resolver records, per resolution pass, every plaintext secret VALUE it
 * substituted together with the original `{{resolve:...}}` expression it came
 * from (a `RecordedSecretValues` map on `ResolverContext`). This module turns
 * that record into two pure operations:
 *
 * - {@link redactSecretsForState} rewrites the bag cdkd is about to PERSIST so
 *   each secret value is replaced by the original unresolved expression. This
 *   is CloudFormation-parity: CFn keeps the `{{resolve:...}}` reference in the
 *   template and resolves it service-side, so the concrete value never lands in
 *   a persisted artifact. Storing the expression (rather than a blind `***`
 *   marker) also means the next `cdkd deploy` diffs expression-vs-expression
 *   and does not spuriously re-apply the resource on every run.
 *
 * - {@link maskSecretsInText} replaces any known secret value inside an
 *   arbitrary string with a fixed marker, for log / error-message paths where
 *   the resolved value would otherwise be echoed (`Fn::Join` / `Fn::Sub` debug
 *   lines, the Cloud Control JSON-patch log, AWS validation errors quoting the
 *   offending value).
 *
 * Both operations work by VALUE match rather than by property path: a resolved
 * secret is a distinctive plaintext string that appears in the resolved bag (or
 * a concatenated `Fn::Join` / `Fn::Sub` result) exactly where it was
 * substituted, so a value scan covers the embedded cases uniformly without
 * threading a path argument through every resolver method. Over-redaction (a
 * coincidental match elsewhere) is harmless and the safe direction; under-
 * redaction would leak a secret, so a match is always replaced.
 *
 * The module is a LEAF — it imports nothing — because both the resolver and the
 * deploy engine consume it and both already sit on a dense import ring.
