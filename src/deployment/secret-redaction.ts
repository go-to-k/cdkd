/**
 * Secret redaction for resolved dynamic references (GHSA fix).
 *
 * CloudFormation dynamic references (`{{resolve:secretsmanager:...}}`) are
 * resolved to plaintext by `IntrinsicFunctionResolver.resolveDynamicReferences`
 * so the concrete secret can be handed to the AWS API on create / update. That
 * plaintext must NEVER be persisted to cdkd state or shown in CLI output, or
 * anyone with read access to the state bucket / terminal logs recovers the
 * secret — which defeats the entire point of storing it in Secrets Manager.
 *
 * The resolver records, per resolution pass, every plaintext secret VALUE it
 * substituted together with the original `{{resolve:...}}` expression it came
 * from (a `RecordedSecretValues` map on `ResolverContext`). This module turns
 * that record into two pure operations:
 *
 * - {@link redactSecretsForState} rewrites the bag cdkd is about to PERSIST so
 *   each secret value is replaced by the original unresolved expression. This
 *   is CloudFormation-parity: CFn keeps the `{{resolve:...}}` reference in the
 *   template and resolves it service-side, so the concrete value never lands in
 *   a persisted artifact. Storing the expression (rather than a blind `***`
 *   marker) also means the next `cdkd deploy` diffs expression-vs-expression
 *   and does not spuriously re-apply the resource on every run.
 *
 * - {@link maskSecretsInText} replaces any known secret value inside an
 *   arbitrary string with a fixed marker, for log / error-message paths where
 *   the resolved value would otherwise be echoed (`Fn::Join` / `Fn::Sub` debug
 *   lines, the Cloud Control JSON-patch log, AWS validation errors quoting the
 *   offending value).
 *
 * {@link maskSecretsInText} works by VALUE match alone: a resolved secret is a
 * distinctive plaintext string, so a value scan covers the embedded cases
 * uniformly without threading a path argument through every resolver method.
 * Over-redaction (a coincidental match elsewhere) is harmless and the safe
 * direction; under-redaction would leak a secret, so a match is always
 * replaced. {@link redactSecretsForState} layers POSITION on top of that scan —
 * see its own doc and {@link redactByPath} — because a value match cannot tell
 * two expressions apart once they resolve to the same plaintext.
 *
 * The module is a LEAF — it imports nothing — because both the resolver and the
 * deploy engine consume it and both already sit on a dense import ring.

 * Every `{{resolve:...}}` expression this process has PROVEN resolves to a

 *
 * This is the piece {@link RecordedSecretValues} structurally cannot supply.
 * That map is keyed by the resolved PLAINTEXT, so when two expressions resolve
 * to the same value it keeps only the last, and asking it whether the LOSING
 * expression was a secret answers "no" — for precisely the pair the path-based
 * redaction exists to separate. The losing leaf then falls through to the value
 * scan and is persisted holding its SIBLING's expression: a permanent spurious
 * UPDATE, and on the rollback-journal replay path a re-resolution of the wrong
 * reference against the live resource.
 *
 * EVERY secret expression is recorded, not only the `ssm` ones (issue
 * [#1916](https://github.com/go-to-k/cdkd/issues/1916)). Only `ssm` needs an
 * entry to answer "is this secret?" — a `secretsmanager` reference is secret by
 * SPELLING (see {@link isKnownSecretExpression}), decidable with no lookup and
 * no memory, while an `ssm` one is secret only when its parameter is a
 * `SecureString`, knowable only from the `GetParameter` response. But this set
 * answers a SECOND question: it is the CANDIDATE LIST
 * {@link positionByIntrinsicSkeleton} matches an intrinsic source leaf against,
 * and there the losing member of a collapsed
 * secretsmanager/secretsmanager pair must be nameable too. Holding only the ssm
 * half made the set's name a lie and left that pair unpositionable.
 *
 * One kind is deliberately still absent: an `ssm` reference whose `Type` came
 * back unclassifiable is treated as secret for THAT resolution but not pinned,
 * so the next pass re-asks AWS rather than inheriting a transient answer
 * (issue #1901). Recording it here would pin it for the process.
 *
 * It lives in THIS module rather than in the resolver even though the resolver
 * is its only writer, for two reasons. This module is the LEAF — the resolver
 * already imports it, so the store is reachable from the writer without adding
 * an edge, while the reverse (a leaf importing the resolver) would close a
 * cycle. And the READER is {@link isKnownSecretExpression} right here, so
 * homing it here means no call site has to thread it: the four sibling writers
 * #1910 fixes pass a position SOURCE and nothing else.
 *
 * Its lifetime matches the resolver's `cachedDynamicReferences` — the resolver
 * clears both together, and that shared lifetime is the point: this set IS the
 * resolver's own SecureString verdict store, which already had exactly this
 * scope, so nothing is widened by homing it here.
 *
 * Process-wide is therefore INHERITED, not claimed to be ideal. It is not
 * strictly sound across regions or accounts in one run — the same expression
 * can name a `SecureString` in one region and a plain `String` in another — but
 * `cachedDynamicReferences` caches the resolved VALUE under the same
 * assumption, so a per-region store here would fix nothing on its own. Note
 * which way the imprecision points: an entry only ever GRANTS "persist the
 * source leaf verbatim", and the leaf is the resource's own template
 * expression, so the failure mode is a public reference stored as an expression
 * (a spurious UPDATE, issue #1901's class), never a secret stored as plaintext.

/**
 * The two rules the path pass needs, which are ORTHOGONAL — this was one
 * parameter and the conflation was a real defect (found by review, reproduced
 * against the branch tip).
 *
 * They are decided by DIFFERENT bags:
 *
 * - `descendArrays` follows the BAG's provenance. Positional descent is sound
 *   only when the bag was PRODUCED BY resolving the source, so the two have
 *   identical structure. The persisted `properties` is
 *   `effectiveProperties ?? desiredProperties`, so a provider-NARROWED bag can
 *   be walked against the template; every `effectiveProperties` producer today
 *   preserves length and order on an equal-length array, and the length check
 *   below is what makes a producer that stops doing so fall to the value scan
 *   rather than mis-align. An AWS readback may be REORDERED — AWS does not
 *   preserve list order, which is the whole reason
 *   `src/analyzer/drift-normalize.ts` exists — and descending it positionally
 *   would write an expression onto the WRONG element while leaving the real
 *   secret in plaintext.
 * - `trustAnyExpression` follows the SOURCE's provenance. A persisted STATE bag
 *   holds no public expressions (a public ssm reference is stored RESOLVED), so
 *   any `{{resolve:...}}` in one is by construction a secret — which is what
 *   lets an UNCHANGED resource be redacted with no secrets map at all (issue
 *   #1900). One narrow exception exists and is worth knowing rather than
 *   asserting around: `cdkd import` warns and persists the RAW template
 *   intrinsic when it cannot resolve one, so a public expression CAN sit in a
 *   record's `properties`. Trusting it here only copies that same literal into
 *   `observedProperties`, which the record already carried, so this does not
 *   make it reach anything new. A TEMPLATE bag carries public and secret expressions alike, so only
 *   a KNOWN secret may be persisted from it, or a `String` / `StringList`
 *   parameter would be stored as its expression and the diff would compare a
 *   resolved desired side against it forever — the perpetual UPDATE issue #1901
 *   exists to prevent.
 *
 * `observedProperties` is exactly the case that proves they are separate: its
 * bag is an AWS readback (so no array descent) while its source may be the
 * TEMPLATE (so no blanket trust). Answering both from one enum leaked the
 * template's public ssm expression into the drift baseline, which
 * `cdkd drift --revert` then pushes back to AWS as a literal.

 * Position a leaf whose SOURCE is an intrinsic OBJECT, by matching the shape of

 * This is the residual {@link redactByPath} left behind. Its plain-string arm
 * persists the source leaf VERBATIM, which needs a source string to copy; when
 * the source leaf is an `Fn::Join` / `Fn::Sub` there is none, so the leaf fell
 * to the value scan — and the value map is keyed by the resolved PLAINTEXT, so
 * a colliding pair collapses there exactly as it did before #1904. That is the
 * DOMINANT CDK shape rather than an edge case: any secret reached through an L2
 * token renders the secret ARN as a `Ref`, hence an `Fn::Join`.
 *
 * Three conditions must ALL hold before an expression is persisted, and each
 * removes a different way of being wrong:
 *
 * 1. The bag leaf's WHOLE value is a recorded secret plaintext. The skeleton
 *    describes ONE complete `{{resolve:...}}` token, so a leaf that merely
 *    EMBEDS a secret (a join with surrounding text) is not this shape at all
 *    and must keep going to the value scan, which rewrites just the substring.
 * 2. EXACTLY ONE candidate matches. Two matching candidates mean the skeleton
 *    genuinely cannot separate them (`{Ref}` in the position that differs), and
 *    guessing would be the collapse this fix exists to remove, one step over.
 * 3. The match is not DEMONSTRABLY another value's expression. The pass's own
 *    map holds each surviving expression against the plaintext it resolved to,
 *    so a candidate recorded there under a DIFFERENT plaintext is refused. That
 *    is what fences a bag/source misalignment: a shape-plausible expression is
 *    rejected outright when the pass can see it resolved to something else. A
 *    candidate absent from that map is a collapsed LOSER, which is the case
 *    this whole function exists to serve, so it is accepted.
 *
 * Every rejection degrades to the value scan, i.e. to today's behavior, so no
 * case gets worse than it is without this pass.
 *
 * One residual is worth naming rather than leaving to be rediscovered: a single
 * WRONG candidate can win only when this leaf's own expression is in NEITHER
 * store — which is exactly an `ssm` reference whose `Type` came back
 * unclassifiable (deliberately unpinned per #1901) and which then lost the
 * value collapse. `recordedSecretExpressions` is process-wide, so the winner
 * could in principle come from another resource, and condition 3 cannot refuse
 * one the pass never recorded.
 *
 * **What that costs is a WRONG REFERENCE in state, not merely a noisy diff.**
 * Persisting another leaf's expression is the pre-#1904 failure exactly:
 * `resolveReplayProps` RE-RESOLVES the persisted expression against AWS and
 * hands the result to `provider.update`, so a rollback replays the wrong secret
 * — immediately, if the two references already resolve to different values. It
 * is narrow (unclassifiable-`ssm` leaves only) but it is not cosmetic, and an
 * earlier draft of this paragraph called it "a spurious UPDATE rather than a
 * disclosure", which understated it.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO {@link isKnownSecretExpression} check here, and the
 * asymmetry with {@link redactByPath}'s plain-string arm is principled rather
 * than an oversight. That arm's candidate is the SOURCE LEAF itself — arbitrary
 * template text, which genuinely can be a PUBLIC ssm reference that must stay
 * resolved in state (issue #1901), so it has to be tested. Here the candidates
 * come only from {@link recordedSecretExpressions} and from the values of a
 * {@link RecordedSecretValues} map, both of which the resolver populates ONLY
 * on a proven-secret verdict — so the test could never answer `false`, and an
 * unfalsifiable guard reads as protection while fencing nothing. Widening
 * either candidate source is what would make it necessary again.

/**
 * PATH-based redaction: walk `bag` alongside a SOURCE bag that still carries the
 * unresolved `{{resolve:...}}` expressions, and wherever the source leaf is such
 * a string, persist THAT string verbatim.
 *
 * This exists because value-keyed redaction cannot answer the question at all
 * when two expressions share one resolved value (issue #1904): the map is keyed
 * by the plaintext, so the two collapse and every site is rewritten to whichever
 * expression was recorded last — state then holds an expression the template
 * does not have at that leaf, and the stack takes a permanent spurious UPDATE.
 * Position is the only disambiguator, and the source bag supplies it.
 *
 * It also covers the case where there is no secrets map to consult at all
 * (issue #1900): an UNCHANGED resource is never resolved during a deploy, so its
 * `perResourceSecrets` entry is empty, and a live readback that echoes a secret
 * would be persisted in plaintext. Projecting from the resource's OWN state
 * record — which already holds the expressions — redacts it with no secret
 * fetch and no value matching.
 *
 * A source leaf that is an intrinsic OBJECT (`Fn::Join` / `Fn::Sub`) has no
 * string to copy, so it goes through {@link positionByIntrinsicSkeleton} first
 * (issue #1916): when the intrinsic's literal parts describe exactly one of the
 * recorded secret expressions, THAT is persisted. This is the dominant CDK
 * shape — an L2 secret token renders the ARN as a `Ref`, hence a join.
 *
 * The value scan is still applied wherever neither can answer: a leaf that
 * merely EMBEDS a secret inside surrounding text, an intrinsic whose skeleton
 * matches zero or several candidates, a diverged shape, a key the source lacks.
 * So the passes are complementary rather than alternatives — path where
 * position is knowable, skeleton where the position is an intrinsic, value
 * where neither is.
